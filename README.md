- 👋 Hi, I’m @arcangelcaido666, a predoctoral researcher based in Salamanca, Spain (for now), going into applied economics and learning Stata, R, Python, and pretty much any language that can help improve my research.
- 👀 I’m into causal inference and microeconometrics, but I also love making clean, well-formatted graphs and maps. For now, I’ll focus on uploading code for my figures. Managing huge datasets with hundreds of thousands of observations might not fit well here, and let's be real—everyone knows how to remove NAs or select the right variables.
- 📚 Topics: labour, health, gender, and pretty much any public policy that begs to be evaluated.
- 🌱 Currently learning Stata, R, and a bit of Python, but my code’s still a work in progress.
- 💞️ Open to collaborations, especially if it's something fun or interesting.
- 📫 You can reach me via email angelsd1998@usal.es or through the social networks linked on my profile.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I also code in my free time! I’ve tried to hack my fantasy football league with friends using R and written some code to generate reports on football matches using web scraping. (Maybe that’ll be my next repository?)
